# Ratings Based Recommender System
Recommend through Collaborative Filtering and Content-Based Filtering

Collaborative Filtering:
Use Pearson Correlation to make recommendations

Content-based Filtering:
Create weighted matrix of genres based on user's ratings profile. Apply weighted matrix to 
original database to find top 20 recommendations

NOTE: original ratings.csv file has more than 22+ million ratings. Couldn't upload onto Github because
of space. So uploaded part of it. The code used the original 22+ million ratings. So running the code
might lead to different results using the ratings.csv from Github.
